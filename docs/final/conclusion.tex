\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
Cloud-based file hosting systems such as Dropbox
are popular and heavily used,
but raise privacy concerns associated with centralized data.

In this work we design and evaluate D-Sync,
a distributed and automatically synchronizing file hosting system.
Our architecture meets our design goals of accuracy, transparency,
scalability, and efficiency.
Finally, we evaluate our system's performance, and find it to
scale well and outperform Dropbox in certain scenarios.
