\section{Appendix}
\label{appendix}
In this appendix we describe the division of labor for this project and reference our code base.
Both Paul and David collaborated evenly on designing the system,
making design decisions,
and researching related work and background material.
David led the way on code development,
with Paul contributing to the client local storage ($db\_utils.py$)
and the client in general.
Paul led the way on writing the paper, with
David contributing with editing, portions of the evaluation and discussion,
and notes for the design.
Both Paul and David shared the workload on evaluating the system and debugging.

Our code base is entirely within a directory called \emph{code/}.
Everything was coded in Python 2.7.2 with some Shell scripts for testing.
We include a README file in this directory which explains the major components
of the code base.
