\begin{abstract}
File hosting systems such as Dropbox and Google Drive
are widely used Internet tools for data storage and backup,
collaborative work, and file sharing.
These systems, while increasingly popular, 
rely on centralized storage of data,
which pose inherent privacy concerns for certain types of users and working groups.
In this work, we present D-Sync, a distributed file hosting architecture
that allows users to store and share data from workspace directories on local machines.
All workspace directories are updated and synchronized whenever an offline user
connects to the system, and whenever an online user makes a change to his workspace directory.
In evaluating our design, 
we show that D-Sync scales reasonably with workload and outperforms Dropbox
with respect to total synchronization time.
Furthermore, we show that our system maintains data
consistency despite arbitrary node failures.
